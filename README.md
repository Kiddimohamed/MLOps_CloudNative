# MLOps Course Project README

## Overview
This project is part of an MLOps course, focusing on practical implementation and understanding of various tools and technologies in the machine learning operationalization landscape. The project encompasses multiple workshops (ateliers) that cover a range of topics from web development using Flask and FastAPI to advanced machine learning deployment with Azure ML DevOps, Amazon SageMaker, and microservices architecture.

### Ateliers:
1. **Flask (Atelier 1):**
   Introduction to web development using Flask framework.

2. **FastAPI (Atelier 2):**
   Understanding and implementation of FastAPI for building efficient APIs.

3. **MLflow (Atelier 4):**
   Utilizing MLflow for managing the machine learning lifecycle.

4. **Azure ML DevOps (Atelier 5):**
   Implementing machine learning pipelines and DevOps practices on Azure.

5. **Microservices API (Atelier 6):**
   Designing and deploying microservices-based architecture for APIs.

6. **Amazon SageMaker (Atelier 8):**
   Leveraging Amazon SageMaker for scalable machine learning model training and deployment.

7. **Model Testing with Locust (Atelier 9):**
   Exploring and conducting model testing using Locust for performance evaluation.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience and exposure to a comprehensive set of tools and methodologies relevant to MLOps. Through practical workshops, participants will gain proficiency in various stages of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and model development to deployment, monitoring, and testing.

## How to Use
Each atelier contains specific instructions and readme , exercises, and resources tailored to the respective topic. Participants are encouraged to follow the guidelines provided in each session to gain a holistic understanding of MLOps practices.
